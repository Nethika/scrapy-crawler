The proposed MOAR study falls under the 'Ground Systems - Soldier/Squad Technologies' section of the DARPA Tactical Technology Office (TTO) Wide Broad Agency Announcement DARPA-BAA-15-27: 'Innovative Systems for Military Missions'. According to a Notional Study Schedule posted by the DARPA, the duration of the MOAR research effort is expected to be of 15-months duration, with the final report due back to the DARPA by second quarter 2017. The MOAR study focuses on two principal areas of research: i) multi-use rounds \"capable of defeating a wide range of threats - dismounted personnel, hardened structures, moving vehicles, armour, and unmanned aerial systems - with traditional and non-traditional defeat mechanisms\"; and ii) multi-function rounds, which should be \"capable of being fired as a shoulder-launched or vehicle-mounted weapon; capable of first-party targeting or receiving targeting information from a networked third party source\". According to a Special Program Announcement for the DARPA/TTO 'Research Opportunity: Massive Overmatch Assault Round (MOAR) Study' (Special Notice DARPA-SN-15-79), \"MOAR will seek to leverage commercial technologies to provide a low-cost, multi-use, and multi-function precision engagement capability. Current short-range weapons are used against a variety of target sets using different munitions and launchers without the benefit of active guidance. Current long-range weapons in support of dismounted operations are highly effective against a specific target set at range, but come with a heavy physical burden, high cost per shot/procurement cost, and often require teams of operators (sometimes dedicated) for employment,\" the announcement notes.", "key_points": "The research effort is expected to be of some 15-months duration, according to a Massive Overmatch Assault Round Notional Study Schedule posted by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Saab will conduct studies using its own Carl-Gustaf and AT4 shoulder-fired weapons, both of which are current US Army Programs of Record."},

The patrol, which did not cross the 12 n-mile territorial limit of any of the features, was intended to challenge Chinese claims in the disputed waters, an official told the newspaper. \"USS (DDG 73) conducted this transit in a routine, lawful manner without ship escorts and without incident,\" US Department of Defense spokesman Commander Gary Ross was quoted by the paper as saying. \"The United States conducts these routine operations on a regular basis around the world, in full compliance with international law,\" he added. The operation was first reported by Reuters news agency. White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said at a news briefing that same day that the purpose of the mission was to \"uphold the rights and freedoms of all states under international law\" as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, also known as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \"This operation demonstrated that coastal states may not unlawfully restrict the navigation rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea that the United States and all states are entitled to exercise under international law,\" said the spokesperson. China's Ministry of National Defense (MND) condemned the move as \"illegal and provocative\", adding that two Chinese guided missile destroyers warned the US vessel to leave the area. \"This has proved that the US side is the 'troublemaker' in the stability of the South China Sea,\" MND spokesman Wu Qian was quoted by the newspaper as saying. \"China will work together with other nations in the area to firmly defend peace and stability in the South China Sea region,\" he added.", "key_points": ""},

HHI received a notice of the PHP15,744,571,584 (USD311 million) award earlier in 2016. The company was previously reported to have won the contract with a design based on the company's HDF-3000 multipurpose frigate design, which features an overall length of 114.3 m, and has been used as the basis for the Republic of Korea Navy's (RoKN's) Incheon (FFX-I)-class guided-missile frigates. HHI has since disclosed in its media release that the platform will instead feature overall length of 107 m, a standard displacement of about 2,600 tonnes, and an operational survivability up to Sea State 5. The frigate has however been described by HHI as one that inherits main design features of the Incheon class, albeit with a lighter displacement. The ship will feature a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion system, and feature a maximum speed of 25 kt, with a standard range of 4,500 n miles at 15 kt. HHI did not disclose in writing specific details of the platform's weapon systems, saying only that the frigates will be \"heavily armed with missiles, torpedo, guns and sensors\", and that they will be capable of anti-air, anti-surface, anti-submarine and electronic warfare.

Tactical Persistent Surveillance (TPS) not only provides cost-effective enhanced situational awareness but it can be set up and operational in 30 minutes even in areas where infrastructure is non-existent or destroyed, according to SES. Although aerostats equipped with persistent surveillance sensors are not new, a number of companies have systems deployed to Afghanistan for force protection or along the United States southern border for border security, what is new about SES' TPS is that for the first time an aerostat will be SATCOM enabled, Nicole Robinson, corporate vice-president of government market solutions for SES, told . Adding a SATCOM capability now enables the sensor aboard the aerostat to transmit intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) video and data over satellite using small aperture and quick to deploy flyaway Ku-band antennas, according to SES. Sensor data are transmitted to a ground station down a tether that uses copper instead of fibre optics. Copper is a better material to work with for tethers, Dave Codacovi, general manager of government technologies for SES told . Processing occurs at the ground station, which is made up of a couple of rack units of equipment, modems, and spectrum analysers. The data are then transmitted via SATCOM to anywhere in the world, Robinson said. \"You can imagine networking aerostats around a particular area of interest and all of that imagery is being collected and sent back to a headquarters located anywhere in the world for complete situational awareness of what is going on [at those locations],\" she said. The company launched its new offering with a demonstration in Reston, Virginia on 22 September. Of the 12 international representatives on hand for the event, three have asked for written proposals for a technical solution.", "key_points": ""},

These systems are intended to supplement the initial three sets delivered to Italy earlier in 2016 as part of a planned programme to update the Italian Army's FH-70 155 mm/39-calibre towed howitzer inventory. Another significant part of the Italian Army's FH-70 upgrade requirement is a new ARIS-developed 40 kW diesel auxiliary power unit (APU), which replaces the original 1,800 cc Volkswagen petrol engine-based APU. As set out by its then artillery commander Major General Giovanni Domenico Pintus in March 2015, the Italian Army's aspiration was to upgrade those FH-70s still in its inventory (with an original order of 164) after prototype validation. At the time his hope was embark on trials in early 2016, but the first howitzer was not fitted with LINAPS until July. The expectation now is that live-firing tests will begin in November 2016. In the interim, the prototype upgrade packages will be assessed for mobility and electromagnetic compatibility, and proving the digital integration of LINAPS with the Italian Army's overarching SIF (Sistema Informatico Fuoco) joint fires integration system. All being well, the full-rate upgrade programme is expected to begin implementation from 2017 onward. The on-gun elements of the LINAPS system that Leonardo is providing include a FIN3110 inertial navigation unit with an integral GPS receiver, and a colour layer's display and control unit (LDCU), common to those provided by Leonardo for the British Army's earlier LINAPS Mk2 105 mm light gun upgrade programme. Supplementing these is a customised tripod-mounted detachment commander's display terminal (DCDT), comparable to the initial model introduced at the behest of the Canadian Army for its LINAPS-equipped M777 155 mm lightweight howitzers deployed on operations in Afghanistan in 2007.", "key_points": ""},
