Army Major General Gary Volesky, the commander of the land component of the US-led Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), told reporters during a 19 October video conference that he had seen reports of 3,000 to 5,000 Islamic State fighters inside Mosul, but there were indications that some are leaving the city. Nevertheless, he added that, \"we expect there will be a fight\". Gen Volesky said foreign fighters were expected to stay as they would find it harder than their Iraqi counterparts to disguise themselves as civilians and pass the screening process on the front lines. \"Our assessment is that they'll be the people who want to stay and fight ... because they really don't have any other place to go,\" he said. Mosul is not currently surrounded as the government forces advancing northwards have yet to link up with the Kurdish forces to the west of the city, leaving a gap of around 60 km through which Islamic State fighters could escape. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists on the same day that \"the city is not fully encircled\". \"I hope it's because they simply couldn't do it, not because they wouldn't do it, but this corridor poses a risk that Islamic State fighters could flee from Mosul and go to Syria,\" he said. \"It is the responsibility of the [US-led] coalition to cut the road to Syria for Daesh,\" Abadi told Iraqi TV using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. Gen Volesky declined to directly answer a question about whether a gap was being intentionally left open, although he suggested CJTF-OIR would attempt to target militants withdrawing along this route.", "author": "Daniel Wasserbly, Washington, DC and Jeremy Binnie, London", "IHS": "IHS Jane's Defence Weekly", "date": "21 October 2016"},

Despite the apparent lack of success, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced a 24-hour extension to the ceasefire until the evening of 21 October. The ceasefire followed a unilateral bombing pause by the Russian air wing deployed to Syria that began on 18 October. Opposition groups in the city denounced the ceasefire and opening of 'humanitarian corridors' out of Aleppo by the Syrian government forces as a trick to try to force the evacuation and then surrender of the city. There were media reports on 20 October of mortar and small-arms fire along the confrontation lines in the city, with the Russian military reporting three of its officers, who were manning a checkpoint on one of eight humanitarian corridors, suffering \"slight injuries\". The three weeks running up to the pause in bombing saw Syrian government troops capture a swath of land in northern Aleppo city since starting a major offensive against the besieged opposition held enclave on 24 September. The three-week offensive by pro-government forces that preceded the ceasefire captured a swath of largely uninhabited terrain in the north of the city. Syrian Arab Army troops, backed by Palestinian militia fighters, pushed around 4 km into the opposition-held enclave across a 4 km front. The extent of the advance was confirmed by statements from government and opposition spokesmen, as well as analysis of news and social media imagery showing key landmarks being occupied by government troops. Syrian troops of the 102nd and 106th Republican Guards Brigades, supported by contingents from the Palestinian Liwa al-Quds militia, were filmed using tanks, artillery, anti-tank guided weapons, and anti-aircraft guns during the advance.", "author": "Tim Ripley, London", "IHS": "IHS Jane's Defence Weekly", "date": "21 October 2016"},

The Kongsberg MCRWS has been designed for new-build tracked and wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as well as older vehicles as an upgrade. Under an Urgent Needs Requirement the US Army 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Europe is to rapidly acquire a batch of 8x8 Stryker vehicles fitted with the Kongsberg MCRWS, which will be armed with the Orbital ATK Armament Systems 30 mm XM813 cannon and a 7.62 mm co-axial machine gun (MG). The XM813 is a spiral development from the 30 mm weapon originally developed for the XM1206 Infantry Combat Vehicle (ICV) - a member of the Future Combat System (FCS) - which was followed by the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). Both programmes were subsequently cancelled. General Dynamics Land Systems has a contract for eight prototype/pre-production Stryker vehicles to be followed by 83 production vehicles. Kongsberg is now supplying these MCRWS as a sub-contractor to General Dynamics Land Systems. The 30 mm XM813 is a dual-feed cannon with a heavier barrel and features a new dual recoil system to enable it to be installed in the MCRWS. The Meggitt linkless ammunition feed system has two ammunition boxes with each containing 150 rds of ammunition, which can be reloaded from within the vehicle under armour protection. In addition to firing all natures of 30 x 173 mm ammunition including armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high-explosive incendiary (HE-I) and training rounds, it will also fire a 30 mm programmable air-burst munition (ABM), designated the MK310. All current Stryker ICVs and most of the specialised variants are fitted with a Kongsberg Protector RWS, which is normally armed with a .50 calibre M2 HB MG or a 40 mm MK19 automatic grenade launcher (AGL).", "author": "Christopher F Foss, London", "IHS": "IHS Jane's International Defence Review", "date": "21 October 2016"},

A ground-based laser designator was used in the first instance, with the aircraft self-designating in later tests using its L-3 Wescam MX-15Di electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turret. First revealed in September 2013, the tandem twin-seat and twin-engine Scorpion jet has been developed to suit mission sets including counter-insurgency, border patrol, maritime surveillance, counter-narcotics, and air defence, in a package set to cost no more than USD20 million to procure and USD3,000 per hour to operate. Textron AirLand has built the aircraft around a 2.3 m cubed payload bay in the centre of its fuselage that can accept a variety of sensors and weapons systems, depending on the mission. Scorpion also has six underwing hardpoints - three on each side - to carry additional sensors, fuel, or weapons. It has been seen at a number of air shows carrying the Textron G-CLAW and Textron/Thales Fury guided glide munitions. Company-supplied performance specifications give the Scorpion a top speed of 450 kt, a service ceiling of 45,000 ft, and a ferry range of 4,450 km.

Although billed primarily as a jet trainer platform, the M-346 does have a secondary offensive capability. Fitted with nine hardpoints (four under each wing and one on the centreline for an optional cannon pod), the M-346 can carry a range of 'dumb' and 'smart' munitions, such as Mk 82/83/84 unguided bombs and GBU-12/16 and Opher Mk 82 guided bombs.
